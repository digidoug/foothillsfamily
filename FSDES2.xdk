            "title": "Should the Government of Alberta be funding private schools?",
            "article": "<p>By Drew Chipman,&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Corporate Services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been quite a bit of back and forth in the news lately regarding public funding of private schools and whether or not the Government of Alberta should continue to provide them with funding. There are arguments on both sides of the issue: those arguing that it takes dollars away from public education and those stating that it saves money because if those students were in the public system they would be 100% funded vs. the 60 or 70% private schools receive.&nbsp; Another pro-private school funding argument is that private schools provide more &ldquo;choice&rdquo; and that taking away funding diminishes that option for families interested in a private school education for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private schools wishing to access provincial funding must fit within two different classes to qualify for provincial support: Level 1 funded private schools have to follow basic reporting requirements and government oversight to obtain 60% funding.&nbsp; Level 2 funded private schools agree to additional scrutiny by fully participating in the provincial accountability program and, once accepted as a Level 2 school must stay at that level in order to receive 70% funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how many students are attending private schools in Alberta?&nbsp; One report written in 2015 by&nbsp;Van Pelt, Nevins, Brown and&nbsp;Palacios1&nbsp;revealed that in 2013 there were slightly less than 25,000 private school students out of more than 619,000 students, or 3.9% of the student population. This number, while not insignificant, is the second lowest of all but the Maritime provinces according to the same report. Between 2001-2013, private school attendance increased as a percentage of total student population in every province except Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; this despite the fact that many of these provinces have not increased contributions to private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Alberta, private schools were funded at 50% of public school funding until 1998 when it was increased to 60%. In 2008, private schools received another increase to 70% for those schools agreeing to the Level 2 certification. In both instances, public schools and their boards had little input into the changes. Currently, the Alberta School Boards Association is asking the provincial government to redirect the approximately $248 million dollars paid to private schools into public education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ourkids.net/\">www.ourkids.net</a>, states that private schools in Alberta charge between $5,000 and $50,000 a year for tuition. If you look at what Foothills School Division receives from the province each year per student, approximately $10,900 through a variety of grants (based on our 2014/15 Audited Financial Statement), you can see that the addition of provincial funding (up to 70% of public school funding) can&nbsp;give private schools a significant leg up on what they have to spend per student compared to&nbsp;public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the fact that private schools receive provincial funding over and above tuition charged,&nbsp;it is important to note that private schools&nbsp;set the criteria for enrolment. For example, they can accept or turn away students with physical or learning disabilities. While public education in the province celebrates its diversity and the fact that we are inclusive&nbsp;of all students, the public, government and private sectors often compare our student results to those of our private school counterparts. It is not an &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The argument that if the government doesn&rsquo;t provide funding to private schools those students will come back to the public systems and then the province will have to provide full funding for all 25,000 private schools students may seem to make sense on the surface. The &nbsp;reasoning goes on to say that if private students are added back into the system it will then reduce the amount of funding available per student across the province. &nbsp;However, if Ontario is any indication, this is certainly not the case. They have a significantly higher number of private schools and students (both in raw numbers and as a percentage of total student population) and yet they provide no provincial funding for private schools. One can surmise that those desiring a private school education for their children are not motivated by the amount of provincial funding private schools receive, or lack thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foothills School Division is certainly in favour of educational choice for students and families. However, we are not sure that choice means provincial funding for private schools&nbsp;should have to accompany that determination. &nbsp;In fact, FSD trustees recently passed a motion &ldquo;in favour of a funding model that fully supports our public education system and does not diminish or erode funding from public education in Alberta.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this information in hand, perhaps it&rsquo;s time that the Province reviewed its stance on the continued funding of private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/where-our-students-are-educated-measuring-student-enrolment-in-canada.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Where Our Students Are Educated: Measuring Student Enrolment in Canada</a></p>\r\n",

            "article": "<h2>By Darlene Cox, FNMI Success Connector, Oilfields School/Longview School</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuesday, June 21 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100013718/1100100013719\" target=\"_blank\">National Aboriginal Day</a>&nbsp;in Canada.&nbsp;This is the day then Governor General of Canada, Rom&eacute;o Leblanc designated 20 years ago&nbsp;to recognize and celebrate Canada&rsquo;s First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit culture and their outstanding contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I would like to share some information on my background and my work in FSD. I am M&eacute;tis/Swampy Cree, and I am the&nbsp;division&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit Success Connector. I am based primarily out of the Oilfields and Longview schools. Between the&nbsp;two, there&nbsp;are approximately 65 self-identified First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit students. Through FSD&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit (FNMI) program, we celebrate and share the diverse indigenous culture of our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be familiar with&nbsp;the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action</a>, developed by Canada&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=905\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Commission&nbsp;</a>to &ldquo;redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oilfields&rsquo; FNMI program is leading the way by acting on actions 63.ii and 63.iii:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>63.&nbsp; We call upon the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada to maintain an annual commitment to Aboriginal education issues, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii.&nbsp; Sharing information and best practices on teaching curriculum related to residential schools and Aboriginal history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Building student capacity for intercultural understanding, empathy, and mutual respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we have created an area for our FNMI students to share space and culture with other students. &ldquo;Turtle Lodge&rdquo; in the Learning Commons showcases the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ojibweresources.weebly.com/ojibwe-teachings--the-7-grandfathers.html\" target=\"_blank\">7 Grandfather Teachings</a>, indigenous medicines, reading materials, indigenous events, and education opportunities, and has become a very popular place for all students.&nbsp;Turtle Lodge was named by 2015 Oilfields graduate Tashena Daniels of the Stoney Nakoda Nation, Eden Valley Band, for Turtle Island, which is what our First Nations people called North America pre-European contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we believe it is important to bridge the gap between FNMI students, including their culture and history, with other students. For most FNMI activities we invite all students of Oilfields and Longview to participate,&nbsp;giving students the space and time&nbsp;to build relationships, and&nbsp;gain a better understanding of all cultures and backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Students participating in a Blanket Exercise, a tool to share the historic &amp; contemporary relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada. Blankets arranged on the floor represent land and participants are invited to step into the roles of FNMI peoples</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This spring, over 50&nbsp;Oilfields students &mdash; both indigenous and non-indigenous &mdash;&nbsp;participated in an experiential learning project.&nbsp;They wrote, directed, acted and filmed&nbsp;four short films,&nbsp;#TRC4Reelz, based on the theme &ldquo;Reconciliation&nbsp;Through the Eyes of our Youth&rdquo;. The purpose of the project was to explore the true story of reconciliation; the films were the bonus. Barriers were worked through; understanding, empathy and mutual respect&nbsp;were created; and the landscape of&nbsp;Oilfields&nbsp;has positively&nbsp;changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 2nd,&nbsp;22 Oilfields film students were invited to attend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/redx-talks-to-lead-debate-on-truth-reconciliation-and-future\" target=\"_blank\">REDx Talks: Truth, Reconciliation and the Future&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(indigenous version of Ted Talks*) at the University of Calgary.&nbsp; Mentorship and creating youth mentors is key to the success of all our youth.

We invite all to join us in embracing these teachings and partaking in the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiy Hiy (Thank You)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darlene Cox</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:coxd@fsd38.ab.ca\">coxd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less).

            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about failure &ndash; I think about iterating!&rdquo;(Wagner, 2012, p. 44).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image00.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />In previous posts, I&rsquo;ve spoken at length about the potential risks our children must navigate in an increasingly technology driven and connected world. Since technology is however a key component of both their lives and ours, the question needs to be bigger than, &ldquo;how do we keep our kids safe from technology?&rdquo; We must also ask, &ldquo;To what extent can technology help our children become critical thinkers, innovative problem solvers and resilient, ethical citizens?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enter the &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; movement.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image03.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Student jaws drop when I tell them that I am older than the internet (just barely &ndash; to be fair). For&nbsp;many of us that grew up in that era, we had TVs with a mechanical knob (and the semi-reliable fine tune), computers existed (however, very few people had them in their homes), music was delivered via spinning vinyl, and robots were personable thinking trashcans on movie screens. Yet, because things were simpler, we understood how to fix them. Seeing a car hood open or a washing machine taken apart was not uncommon. &nbsp;Science kits like the classic Radio Shack electronics project kits, were popular toys that let kids make sense of how things worked. When things didn&rsquo;t work we fixed them or &ldquo;jerry rigged&rdquo; a replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image01.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Today, technology is commonplace and often takes the form of warranty sealed, tamper proof devices. &nbsp;Everything you buy has a computer in it and most devices take the form of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;. &nbsp;For example, do you know what the inside of your cellular phone looks like or how it works?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why in education we look to &ldquo;maker spaces&rdquo;. &nbsp;Places where students can inquire into how things work and invent solutions to authentic problems. These maker spaces take multiple forms. For example, a design lab where students use software like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sketchup.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGv7CsupNGxy31b6_-M37WXU1pNQ\">Google Sketchup</a>&nbsp;to design a solution to a problem and then use a fabrication device known as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq8l8B8l9eDa9jS35ZPllhixACtg\">3D printer</a>&nbsp;to instantly render and test a prototype. In a Science or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://albertactf.ca/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdoqIwYbbr0MA8x6ZvsiykwuVEnw\">Career and Technology Foundations</a>&nbsp;classroom students may design and build circuits or modular robots to solve a problem or perform a task. &nbsp;Schools are even including makerspaces to give students a place to explore ideas from their personal interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image02.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />The common element in all of this is that the students are inventing and problem solving. They are seeking to understand how things work and using that understanding to create and design new solutions to complex and authentic problems. &nbsp;They learn to &ldquo;troubleshoot&rdquo; their designs when they don&rsquo;t work as expected. They learn to think critically and&nbsp;repeatedly about design elements and might go through multiple revisions until finally settling on a solution. Most importantly, they learn to be persistent problem solvers who expect problems to be both challenging and based in the real world &mdash;&nbsp;a skill that helps them not only with school based curriculum, but also prepares them to be resilient lifelong learners in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca\">+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagner, T.

            "title": "A Downside of Mobile Technology",
            "article": "<p>By Lyle Roberts,&nbsp;Director of Learning Technologies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of mobile devices is becoming&nbsp;increasingly prevalent as time goes on. The reasons behind this are varied, however, having a portable device that can be used anywhere, anytime is proving to be a valuable tool for most people. No longer are you required to have a fixed location to do whatever you want. In fact, being able to do your work or have fun at your fingertips makes things more convenient. However,&nbsp;there is a down side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It used to be that there were certain brands of computing devices that people gravitated to for all of their computing needs. There is still an element of a particular brand of computing device that works better or has a better interface for a certain task. However,&nbsp;in general, this preference&nbsp;for branding is going away and now it has more to do with functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from desktop computing to tablets to mobile computing using cell phones and specialized devices. We&rsquo;re now looking at wearable devices that are designed to track how far you walk, how many stairs you climb, and what your sleep activity levels are like. Many also track your food intake and are able to calculate the calories that you use in a day or for a particular activity. Most of these are used to improve health and, as long as they are used correctly, will do a fairly good job of informing the user of trends and nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a&nbsp;negative use of these types of wearable technologies that track food intake and activity. One such app that is available is used by people suffering with anorexia to limit their caloric intake. In speaking with a dietician recently they called it the, &ldquo;Anorexic&rsquo;s Friend&rdquo;, meaning that people with this condition are using the information that they get from the app to negatively affect their overall health by helping them restrict food intake and&nbsp;the types of&nbsp;foods that they eat in order to lose even more weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the majority of the population&nbsp;reducing their&nbsp;food intake is not a negative thing; instead, it can be a positive way to encourage good health, better nutrition&nbsp;and increased activity. However, when someone suffering with anorexia is&nbsp; trying to lose even more weight, this obviously will have a detrimental effect on the health of the human body. Essentially the lack of calories and nutrients eventually puts the lives of these people at risk unless the cycle of starvation can be reversed. This is not easily done as there are many underlying factors to this condition. Health professionals continue to struggle with how best to treat individuals with this condition. One suggestion would be to use the app to help the individual&nbsp;gain&nbsp;weight rather than lose&nbsp;it, but this requires a huge mind shift in their thinking. A second suggestion would be to make sure that they don&rsquo;t use these types of apps at all so they are unable to&nbsp;track their caloric intake as readily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In either case, anorexia is a complex condition. If technology&nbsp;can help them on the road to recovery,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all for it. However,&nbsp;if the technology is&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;destructive behavior and harming their health, we need to&nbsp;be wary of&nbsp;the use of these types of apps. If you&rsquo;re a parent, be as vigilant as possible about the apps and activities that your children have on their smart phones and other devices.</p>\r\n",

            "title": "It's Time to GET LOUD",
            "article": "<p>By Loriann Salmon,&nbsp;Director of Inclusive Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interplay between success at school and emotional health cannot be ignored and speaks loudly to the need for educators, parents and the community to be active partners in supporting the mental wellness of our children and youth. &nbsp;May 2 &ndash; 8 is Mental Health Week and it&rsquo;s time for all of us to&nbsp;<strong>GET LOUD</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Mental health stat\" src=\"./images/content/Mental-health-stat-293x300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The emergence of recommended universal proactive practices has shifted the focus from one of diagnosing and repairing weakness to a whole school and community approach&nbsp;of supporting the social-emotional development of all students. Collectively, we can all make a difference for our kids.&nbsp;We can support the emotional health of our children and youth through intentional evidence based practices.&nbsp;Two such practices that are found to support the emotional wellness of our youth include a focus on social-emotional learning and connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies results in enhanced positive attitudes about self and others, strengthens connections to school, increases academic performance and reduces both externalizing and internalizing behaviours (Payton et al, 2008; Ashdown &amp; Bernard, 2012).&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence based curriculums such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zonesofregulation.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zones of Regulation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/\" target=\"_blank\">MindUP&trade;</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youthrelationships.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fourth R</a>&nbsp;ensure that these competencies are explicitly taught and then opportunities provided to be practiced throughout the day.&nbsp;Connecting parents to these programs through effective two-way communication ensures that a common language and skills can be reinforced and practiced in all areas of life, both at school and home. These core competencies are not only identified as protective factors contributing to emotional health and resiliency but also enhances connection to others, also considered to be an essential factor in supporting mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connectedness, closely related to the basic need of belonging, takes the intentional work of all stakeholders. Teaming of all stakeholders to develop connectedness is an essential structure in supporting the emotional well-being of our youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family-school connections</strong>&nbsp;where parents are positively and meaningfully involved in their child&rsquo;s learning and connected with the school themselves influences students&rsquo; perception of the importance of school and engagement with school and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peer connectedness</strong>&nbsp;is also essential, particularly as students get older and their peer group becomes more important.&nbsp;Friendship is a strong predictor of life outcomes and focusing on the development of pro-social attitudes through positive interactions with others is essential.&nbsp;In supporting quality of interactions, intentional practices such as classroom circles ensures every student&rsquo;s voice is heard, empathy is developed, and quality relationships and interactions are fostered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School connectedness</strong>, or how students perceive themselves to be accepted by others in the educational environment, is also a key component.&nbsp;This can be supported by practices such as cooperative learning, participation in clubs and activities, utilizing a strengths based approach within the school and class, and providing a continuum of social-emotional and academic supports that ensure access to and success with curricular outcomes.&nbsp;Intentional actions that build relationships, such as the &ldquo;2 X 10&rdquo; strategy, which involves spending 2 minutes a day, 10 days in a row talking to a student about whatever they would like to talk about, also strengthens school connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community connectedness</strong>&nbsp;rounds out the circle of supports.&nbsp; Juvonen (2007) noted youth that can identify adults in the community that care about them experience a stronger sense of personal well-being.&nbsp;When youth feel safe, cared for and are provided opportunities to become connected to the community it broadens their sense of belonging.&nbsp;Furthermore, it provides the opportunity for further cultural connectedness, a strong predictor of emotional wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Get Loud image\" src=\"./images/content/Get-Loud-image-768x428.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GET LOUD</strong>.Finally, while making visible the protective factors of social-emotional competencies and the importance of a collective approach in ensuring connectedness, we also need to get loud about removing the stigma associated with mental illnesses.&nbsp;As one of the greatest barriers to treatment, recovery and societal acceptance, this stigma must be targeted and removed.&nbsp;To raise awareness, increase access to mental health resources and eliminate barriers to achieving full inclusion in society, GET LOUD during Mental Health Week (May 2 &ndash; 8):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Wear Green: Green ribbons were given in the 1800s to label people &ldquo;insane&rdquo;. Mental Health Awareness week is turning that on its head. Be proud and wear green!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud by Speaking Up: Don&rsquo;t suffer silently. Get loud about your own mental health and reach out to talk to someone you trust.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Be That Friend: Offer support, listen without judgement and take the time to ask how someone is doing. Reach out to that person you might not always reach out to.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Creative for Mental Health: Sing it, draw it, act it, or sculpt it. Make the importance of mental wellness visible!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud for Supports: Write letters, call, tweet your local elected representative to increase supports and access to mental health programs and services in your area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More ideas of how to Get Loud can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/</a>.&nbsp;Go there or tweet #GetLoud to share how you&rsquo;re getting loud during mental health week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Tips-for-Positive-Mental-Health.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n",

            "article": "<p>By Cathy Bonnaventure,&nbsp;Director of Early Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our province has created an Alberta Early Learning and Child Care Curriculum Framework in response to the increasing recognition of the importance of early experiences to later development and the significance of the work that Early Childhood Educators do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Preschool kids\" src=\"./images/content/Preschool-kids-300x202.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The idea of a curriculum framework for young children might bring to mind a traditional curriculum &ndash; the kind you remember from grade school, where there&nbsp;were specific learning outcomes for subjects such as language arts and mathematics.&nbsp; In early learning, however, curriculum is focused on the uniqueness of childhood, considering learning with broad holistic goals for children&rsquo;s development and the importance of play, relationships and family diversity.&nbsp; The curriculum framework focuses on the process of the work Early&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height:1.6\">Childhood Educators do and the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height:1.6\">decisions that they make every day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Curriculum Framework is helping all Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) in our Junior Kindergarten classrooms build a common language, share and reflect.&nbsp; This current school year, two Junior Kindergarten programs in Foothills School Division have been participating in an Alberta Early Learning Curriculum Framework Pilot. &nbsp;The pilot sites in Foothills School Division are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Blackie School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Aileen Puurveen-Abmas, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>&Eacute;cole Percy Pegler School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Teresa Taylor, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>Foothills School Division ECS Administrator (me, Cathy Bonnaventure, Director of Early Learning)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot has consisted of three components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The first element of the process has been to connect with a professor from Mount Royal University who provides guidance about pedagogical leadership and ways to engage with Early Childhood Educators around the Curriculum Framework. I have been meeting on a monthly basis with the professor as well as attending learning community sessions with our own and other ECS administrators and Early Childhood Educators. The professor &mdash; also known as our pedagogical partners &mdash; and I have also been visiting the two pilot JK programs in FSD over the course of the pilot to engage with them in a variety of meaningful ways (e.g. spend time in the classroom, engage in planning time, provide opportunities for reflection and dialogue, etc.).</li>\r\n\t<li>The next component has involved bringing together eight (8) ECS educations/school division administrators from four school districts to build a learning community. As a learning community , we have been exploring the language, concepts and processes described in the curriculum documents. The learning community has been meeting once a month to examine our practice in light of questions such as: A) How do we document and make the learning of children visible to others? and B) What is our image of the child, how do we nurture their dispositions for learning, what is our role as the educator, and how do we best provide a learning environment that is responsive to the children&rsquo;s needs?</li>\r\n\t<li>The third component of this process is that the pilot classrooms and programs are visited monthly by a pedagogical partner (professor) from Mount Royal. They spend half a day per month with each ECE in their classroom. Having th epedagogical partner onside provides a means for guiding, support and reflecting on practice. It also provides the opportunity for coaching and mentoring to support the application of the curriculum framework concepts. The professor spends time in the classroom documenting and engaging the educators in dialogue about practice, discussing curriculum connects and curriculum reflections (e.g. planning). These coaching and mentoring opportunities are shared and integrated back into the learning community conversation sessions. This process serves to enhance the skills and practices of the teacher to enrich the experience with children while at the same time providing an experiential forum for discussion. I have also been joining the professor on visits with the JK programs whenever possible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECE&rsquo;s and Director are documenting their experiences throughout the pilot and plan to share what they are learning about the implementation of the Alberta Curriculum Framework in their classrooms at a Showcase at Mount Royal University on June 10, 2016.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the FSD webpage for more details about this exciting event!</p>\r\n",

            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;EVERY industry is desperate to hire computer programmers&rdquo; &ndash; Hadi Partovi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>10 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">PRINT</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(51, 153, 102)\">&ldquo;HELLO WORLD!&rdquo;</span> 20 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">GOTO</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 255)\">10</span></strong></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on when you went to school (for me the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s), you may or may not recognize the above chunk of BASIC code. For me it was an introduction to a whole new world. &nbsp;Not that this code did anything particularly useful &mdash; &nbsp;it filled the screen with a lot of text that scrolled so fast that you couldn&rsquo;t read it. Instead it was the engagement that occurred in realizing that &mdash; much like other forms of art &mdash; I could translate what I imagined into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I progressed into more advanced concepts and different programming languages I found myself exploring mathematical concepts such as variables, algebraic thinking, geometry, logic and patterning. &nbsp;I learned these concepts because I needed them order to make the computer do what I wanted it to. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even think of them as mathematical concepts until I was older and was exposed to them in math class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently I had the opportunity to attend a talk with Reshma Suanji, former Deputy Public Advocate for New York City, Candidate for the United States Congress and founder of the advocacy group &ldquo;Girls who Code&rdquo;. (<a href=\"http://girlswhocode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://girlswhocode.com</a>) During this powerful presentation, Reshma shared some startling statistics regarding economic shifts that could have an&nbsp;immediate impact on our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In 2008 there were 8 million manufacturing jobs lost in the USA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Higher wage technical work grew in that same span of time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Today, computer software engineers are the fastest growing industry for employment with Computer Science close behind.</li>\r\n\t<li>The gender gap in computer sciences is growing.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 1984, 37% of students graduating computer science programs were women; today that ratio is closer to 18%.</li>\r\n\t<li>Although women make up almost half of the US workforce, only 25% of the jobs in technical or computing fields are held by females.</li>\r\n\t<li>It has been predicted that by 2020, 1.4 million computer specialists will be needed in the USA with only enough graduates to fill 29% of them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technical jobs are no longer specific to technical industries. Most industries need staff skilled in computer sciences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The question then is how do we expose our students to these important foundational&nbsp;skills? How can our students benefit from engaging lessons in creativity, problem solving, logic and numeracy? How do we prepare students for &ldquo;their future, not our past&rdquo;(Pink, 2011)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a student, coding or programming meant that I needed to learn a complex text based language. Today, modern tools have made these skills more accessible to all. &nbsp;Although these tools still enable students to creatively explore computer processes, logic, patterns, numeracy and other concepts, students can explore these ideas without having to learn formal text based programming languages. &nbsp;For example &ldquo;Scratch&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://scratch.mit.edu&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948071000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ6iCmadyEieIaGRiuSWYI1Byw0A\">http://scratch.mit.edu</a>&nbsp;and its more complex cousin &ldquo;Stencyl&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stencyl.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDi2QtYDpQ-GMc4bx7kU-wmKaqBA\">http://www.stencyl.com</a>&nbsp;provide environments where students can drag and drop code chunks to create engaging games without needing to learn a formal programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:246px\" title=\"\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture2.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:259px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great way that kids of multiple ages can explore these skills and concepts is by participating in Code.Org&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hour of Code&rdquo; project:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://code.org/learn&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948073000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQPnzjFqLiRNVnvf9_Ue4JmLV0mA\">http://code.org/learn</a>. This project provides all the tools and instruction needed to create interactive games using Minecraft characters, Angry Birds, Disney Infinity characters and more! In a recent TED Talk, Hadi Partovi talked about the importance of projects like this to preparing students for the future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m-U9wzC9xLk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.208px; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background: transparent;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these tools, many of our students explore these concepts through &ldquo;makerspaces&rdquo;. These are classroom and other school based opportunities for students to work with robotics and electronics and, for older students, computer modules such as the Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;Younger students can even work with paper versions of common code blocks&nbsp;by practicing&nbsp;placing them in a logical sequence. These tools are available for all Foothills classrooms through our Instructional Media Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opportunities for students to explore coding have never been better and the need has never been greater. We need to give our children the opportunity to express themselves and create using these technologies as this will be the language of their&nbsp;world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are always welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n",

In a world where every individual interest, issue or item can garner recognition on some calendar or another it becomes difficult to attribute any significance to such a recognition. Depending on the source you look at last few weeks included the following list of world recognition days on the calendar:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Talk Like a Pirate Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Care Free Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Tourism Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Rabies Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Maritime Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Sight Day, and</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Coffee Day.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let&rsquo;s face it, it can be difficult as a citizen to set aside time in your day to mindfully reflect and give a true appreciation to all of these important (or less important) recognitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Still, I urge everyone to do just that here in Foothills School Division as we consider the over 500 Teachers and 110 Guest Teachers supporting our nearly 8000 students. When we contemplate the impact each individual teacher can make on the lives of their students over the course of a year and a career we should all be deeply invested in not only recognizing and appreciating teachers but in collectively ensuring our Teachers are supported to be among the best in the world at their profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In FSD 38 our professional teaching staff is grateful to have a school community lead by our Trustees who recognize this in many ways. This Friday Foothills School Division teachers will be engaged in collaborative professional learning with their colleagues across the Division on one of our 13 Professional Learning Days that are built into the school calendar. These days are essential for teachers to have consistent and regular opportunities to learn from each other, collectively review their instructional practice in light of student assessment, and maintain their understanding of how all students learn. Such an investment indeed allows our staff the opportunity to continuously improve and be among the best at their profession. This learning is vital when educational research reliably demonstrates that having a quality teacher is the most important factor in student achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So, as we mark World Teachers&rsquo; Day this Wednesday and teachers engage in ongoing professional learning this Friday I urge you join me in showing our collective appreciation for Teachers!</p>\r\n",

            "title": "Should the Government of Alberta be funding private schools?",
            "article": "<p>By Drew Chipman,&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Corporate Services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been quite a bit of back and forth in the news lately regarding public funding of private schools and whether or not the Government of Alberta should continue to provide them with funding. There are arguments on both sides of the issue: those arguing that it takes dollars away from public education and those stating that it saves money because if those students were in the public system they would be 100% funded vs. the 60 or 70% private schools receive.&nbsp; Another pro-private school funding argument is that private schools provide more &ldquo;choice&rdquo; and that taking away funding diminishes that option for families interested in a private school education for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private schools wishing to access provincial funding must fit within two different classes to qualify for provincial support: Level 1 funded private schools have to follow basic reporting requirements and government oversight to obtain 60% funding.&nbsp; Level 2 funded private schools agree to additional scrutiny by fully participating in the provincial accountability program and, once accepted as a Level 2 school must stay at that level in order to receive 70% funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how many students are attending private schools in Alberta?&nbsp; One report written in 2015 by&nbsp;Van Pelt, Nevins, Brown and&nbsp;Palacios1&nbsp;revealed that in 2013 there were slightly less than 25,000 private school students out of more than 619,000 students, or 3.9% of the student population. This number, while not insignificant, is the second lowest of all but the Maritime provinces according to the same report. Between 2001-2013, private school attendance increased as a percentage of total student population in every province except Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; this despite the fact that many of these provinces have not increased contributions to private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Alberta, private schools were funded at 50% of public school funding until 1998 when it was increased to 60%. In 2008, private schools received another increase to 70% for those schools agreeing to the Level 2 certification. In both instances, public schools and their boards had little input into the changes. Currently, the Alberta School Boards Association is asking the provincial government to redirect the approximately $248 million dollars paid to private schools into public education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ourkids.net/\">www.ourkids.net</a>, states that private schools in Alberta charge between $5,000 and $50,000 a year for tuition. If you look at what Foothills School Division receives from the province each year per student, approximately $10,900 through a variety of grants (based on our 2014/15 Audited Financial Statement), you can see that the addition of provincial funding (up to 70% of public school funding) can&nbsp;give private schools a significant leg up on what they have to spend per student compared to&nbsp;public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the fact that private schools receive provincial funding over and above tuition charged,&nbsp;it is important to note that private schools&nbsp;set the criteria for enrolment. For example, they can accept or turn away students with physical or learning disabilities. While public education in the province celebrates its diversity and the fact that we are inclusive&nbsp;of all students, the public, government and private sectors often compare our student results to those of our private school counterparts. It is not an &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The argument that if the government doesn&rsquo;t provide funding to private schools those students will come back to the public systems and then the province will have to provide full funding for all 25,000 private schools students may seem to make sense on the surface. The &nbsp;reasoning goes on to say that if private students are added back into the system it will then reduce the amount of funding available per student across the province. &nbsp;However, if Ontario is any indication, this is certainly not the case. They have a significantly higher number of private schools and students (both in raw numbers and as a percentage of total student population) and yet they provide no provincial funding for private schools. One can surmise that those desiring a private school education for their children are not motivated by the amount of provincial funding private schools receive, or lack thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foothills School Division is certainly in favour of educational choice for students and families. However, we are not sure that choice means provincial funding for private schools&nbsp;should have to accompany that determination. &nbsp;In fact, FSD trustees recently passed a motion &ldquo;in favour of a funding model that fully supports our public education system and does not diminish or erode funding from public education in Alberta.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this information in hand, perhaps it&rsquo;s time that the Province reviewed its stance on the continued funding of private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/where-our-students-are-educated-measuring-student-enrolment-in-canada.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Where Our Students Are Educated: Measuring Student Enrolment in Canada</a></p>\r\n",

            "article": "<h2>By Darlene Cox, FNMI Success Connector, Oilfields School/Longview School</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuesday, June 21 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100013718/1100100013719\" target=\"_blank\">National Aboriginal Day</a>&nbsp;in Canada.&nbsp;This is the day then Governor General of Canada, Rom&eacute;o Leblanc designated 20 years ago&nbsp;to recognize and celebrate Canada&rsquo;s First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit culture and their outstanding contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I would like to share some information on my background and my work in FSD. I am M&eacute;tis/Swampy Cree, and I am the&nbsp;division&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit Success Connector. I am based primarily out of the Oilfields and Longview schools. Between the&nbsp;two, there&nbsp;are approximately 65 self-identified First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit students. Through FSD&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit (FNMI) program, we celebrate and share the diverse indigenous culture of our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be familiar with&nbsp;the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action</a>, developed by Canada&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=905\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Commission&nbsp;</a>to &ldquo;redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oilfields&rsquo; FNMI program is leading the way by acting on actions 63.ii and 63.iii:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>63.&nbsp; We call upon the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada to maintain an annual commitment to Aboriginal education issues, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii.&nbsp; Sharing information and best practices on teaching curriculum related to residential schools and Aboriginal history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Building student capacity for intercultural understanding, empathy, and mutual respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we have created an area for our FNMI students to share space and culture with other students. &ldquo;Turtle Lodge&rdquo; in the Learning Commons showcases the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ojibweresources.weebly.com/ojibwe-teachings--the-7-grandfathers.html\" target=\"_blank\">7 Grandfather Teachings</a>, indigenous medicines, reading materials, indigenous events, and education opportunities, and has become a very popular place for all students.&nbsp;Turtle Lodge was named by 2015 Oilfields graduate Tashena Daniels of the Stoney Nakoda Nation, Eden Valley Band, for Turtle Island, which is what our First Nations people called North America pre-European contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we believe it is important to bridge the gap between FNMI students, including their culture and history, with other students. For most FNMI activities we invite all students of Oilfields and Longview to participate,&nbsp;giving students the space and time&nbsp;to build relationships, and&nbsp;gain a better understanding of all cultures and backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Students participating in a Blanket Exercise, a tool to share the historic &amp; contemporary relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada. Blankets arranged on the floor represent land and participants are invited to step into the roles of FNMI peoples</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This spring, over 50&nbsp;Oilfields students &mdash; both indigenous and non-indigenous &mdash;&nbsp;participated in an experiential learning project.&nbsp;They wrote, directed, acted and filmed&nbsp;four short films,&nbsp;#TRC4Reelz, based on the theme &ldquo;Reconciliation&nbsp;Through the Eyes of our Youth&rdquo;. The purpose of the project was to explore the true story of reconciliation; the films were the bonus. Barriers were worked through; understanding, empathy and mutual respect&nbsp;were created; and the landscape of&nbsp;Oilfields&nbsp;has positively&nbsp;changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 2nd,&nbsp;22 Oilfields film students were invited to attend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/redx-talks-to-lead-debate-on-truth-reconciliation-and-future\" target=\"_blank\">REDx Talks: Truth, Reconciliation and the Future&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(indigenous version of Ted Talks*) at the University of Calgary.&nbsp; Mentorship and creating youth mentors is key to the success of all our youth. They are the future to breaking the cycles of colonization and the tragic legacy left behind from residential schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOXcFZgzhI\" target=\"_blank\">Circle of Courage</a>&nbsp; (see the Solution Tree video for an explanation) is the basis of&nbsp;our work in FSD:&nbsp;the spirit of generosity, the spirit of belonging, the spirit of mastery, the spirit of independence. We invite all to join us in embracing these teachings and partaking in the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiy Hiy (Thank You)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darlene Cox</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:coxd@fsd38.ab.ca\">coxd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics &mdash; from science to business to global issues &mdash; in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.</p>\r\n",

            "title": "What Makes a Maker?",
            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about failure &ndash; I think about iterating!&rdquo;(Wagner, 2012, p. 44).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image00.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />In previous posts, I&rsquo;ve spoken at length about the potential risks our children must navigate in an increasingly technology driven and connected world. Since technology is however a key component of both their lives and ours, the question needs to be bigger than, &ldquo;how do we keep our kids safe from technology?&rdquo; We must also ask, &ldquo;To what extent can technology help our children become critical thinkers, innovative problem solvers and resilient, ethical citizens?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enter the &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; movement.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image03.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Student jaws drop when I tell them that I am older than the internet (just barely &ndash; to be fair). For&nbsp;many of us that grew up in that era, we had TVs with a mechanical knob (and the semi-reliable fine tune), computers existed (however, very few people had them in their homes), music was delivered via spinning vinyl, and robots were personable thinking trashcans on movie screens. Yet, because things were simpler, we understood how to fix them. Seeing a car hood open or a washing machine taken apart was not uncommon. &nbsp;Science kits like the classic Radio Shack electronics project kits, were popular toys that let kids make sense of how things worked. When things didn&rsquo;t work we fixed them or &ldquo;jerry rigged&rdquo; a replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image01.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Today, technology is commonplace and often takes the form of warranty sealed, tamper proof devices. &nbsp;Everything you buy has a computer in it and most devices take the form of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;. &nbsp;For example, do you know what the inside of your cellular phone looks like or how it works?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why in education we look to &ldquo;maker spaces&rdquo;. &nbsp;Places where students can inquire into how things work and invent solutions to authentic problems. These maker spaces take multiple forms. For example, a design lab where students use software like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sketchup.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGv7CsupNGxy31b6_-M37WXU1pNQ\">Google Sketchup</a>&nbsp;to design a solution to a problem and then use a fabrication device known as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq8l8B8l9eDa9jS35ZPllhixACtg\">3D printer</a>&nbsp;to instantly render and test a prototype. In a Science or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://albertactf.ca/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdoqIwYbbr0MA8x6ZvsiykwuVEnw\">Career and Technology Foundations</a>&nbsp;classroom students may design and build circuits or modular robots to solve a problem or perform a task. &nbsp;Schools are even including makerspaces to give students a place to explore ideas from their personal interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image02.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />The common element in all of this is that the students are inventing and problem solving. They are seeking to understand how things work and using that understanding to create and design new solutions to complex and authentic problems. &nbsp;They learn to &ldquo;troubleshoot&rdquo; their designs when they don&rsquo;t work as expected. They learn to think critically and&nbsp;repeatedly about design elements and might go through multiple revisions until finally settling on a solution. Most importantly, they learn to be persistent problem solvers who expect problems to be both challenging and based in the real world &mdash;&nbsp;a skill that helps them not only with school based curriculum, but also prepares them to be resilient lifelong learners in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca\">+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagner, T.

            "title": "A Downside of Mobile Technology",
            "article": "<p>By Lyle Roberts,&nbsp;Director of Learning Technologies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of mobile devices is becoming&nbsp;increasingly prevalent as time goes on. The reasons behind this are varied, however, having a portable device that can be used anywhere, anytime is proving to be a valuable tool for most people. No longer are you required to have a fixed location to do whatever you want. In fact, being able to do your work or have fun at your fingertips makes things more convenient. However,&nbsp;there is a down side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It used to be that there were certain brands of computing devices that people gravitated to for all of their computing needs. There is still an element of a particular brand of computing device that works better or has a better interface for a certain task. However,&nbsp;in general, this preference&nbsp;for branding is going away and now it has more to do with functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from desktop computing to tablets to mobile computing using cell phones and specialized devices. We&rsquo;re now looking at wearable devices that are designed to track how far you walk, how many stairs you climb, and what your sleep activity levels are like. Many also track your food intake and are able to calculate the calories that you use in a day or for a particular activity. Most of these are used to improve health and, as long as they are used correctly, will do a fairly good job of informing the user of trends and nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a&nbsp;negative use of these types of wearable technologies that track food intake and activity. One such app that is available is used by people suffering with anorexia to limit their caloric intake. In speaking with a dietician recently they called it the, &ldquo;Anorexic&rsquo;s Friend&rdquo;, meaning that people with this condition are using the information that they get from the app to negatively affect their overall health by helping them restrict food intake and&nbsp;the types of&nbsp;foods that they eat in order to lose even more weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the majority of the population&nbsp;reducing their&nbsp;food intake is not a negative thing; instead, it can be a positive way to encourage good health, better nutrition&nbsp;and increased activity. However, when someone suffering with anorexia is&nbsp; trying to lose even more weight, this obviously will have a detrimental effect on the health of the human body. Essentially the lack of calories and nutrients eventually puts the lives of these people at risk unless the cycle of starvation can be reversed. This is not easily done as there are many underlying factors to this condition. Health professionals continue to struggle with how best to treat individuals with this condition. One suggestion would be to use the app to help the individual&nbsp;gain&nbsp;weight rather than lose&nbsp;it, but this requires a huge mind shift in their thinking. A second suggestion would be to make sure that they don&rsquo;t use these types of apps at all so they are unable to&nbsp;track their caloric intake as readily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In either case, anorexia is a complex condition. If technology&nbsp;can help them on the road to recovery,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all for it. However,&nbsp;if the technology is&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;destructive behavior and harming their health, we need to&nbsp;be wary of&nbsp;the use of these types of apps. If you&rsquo;re a parent, be as vigilant as possible about the apps and activities that your children have on their smart phones and other devices.</p>\r\n",

            "title": "It's Time to GET LOUD",
            "article": "<p>By Loriann Salmon,&nbsp;Director of Inclusive Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interplay between success at school and emotional health cannot be ignored and speaks loudly to the need for educators, parents and the community to be active partners in supporting the mental wellness of our children and youth. &nbsp;May 2 &ndash; 8 is Mental Health Week and it&rsquo;s time for all of us to&nbsp;<strong>GET LOUD</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Mental health stat\" src=\"./images/content/Mental-health-stat-293x300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The emergence of recommended universal proactive practices has shifted the focus from one of diagnosing and repairing weakness to a whole school and community approach&nbsp;of supporting the social-emotional development of all students. Collectively, we can all make a difference for our kids.&nbsp;We can support the emotional health of our children and youth through intentional evidence based practices.&nbsp;Two such practices that are found to support the emotional wellness of our youth include a focus on social-emotional learning and connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies results in enhanced positive attitudes about self and others, strengthens connections to school, increases academic performance and reduces both externalizing and internalizing behaviours (Payton et al, 2008; Ashdown &amp; Bernard, 2012).&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence based curriculums such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zonesofregulation.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zones of Regulation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/\" target=\"_blank\">MindUP&trade;</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youthrelationships.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fourth R</a>&nbsp;ensure that these competencies are explicitly taught and then opportunities provided to be practiced throughout the day.&nbsp;Connecting parents to these programs through effective two-way communication ensures that a common language and skills can be reinforced and practiced in all areas of life, both at school and home. These core competencies are not only identified as protective factors contributing to emotional health and resiliency but also enhances connection to others, also considered to be an essential factor in supporting mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connectedness, closely related to the basic need of belonging, takes the intentional work of all stakeholders. Teaming of all stakeholders to develop connectedness is an essential structure in supporting the emotional well-being of our youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family-school connections</strong>&nbsp;where parents are positively and meaningfully involved in their child&rsquo;s learning and connected with the school themselves influences students&rsquo; perception of the importance of school and engagement with school and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peer connectedness</strong>&nbsp;is also essential, particularly as students get older and their peer group becomes more important.&nbsp;Friendship is a strong predictor of life outcomes and focusing on the development of pro-social attitudes through positive interactions with others is essential.&nbsp;In supporting quality of interactions, intentional practices such as classroom circles ensures every student&rsquo;s voice is heard, empathy is developed, and quality relationships and interactions are fostered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School connectedness</strong>, or how students perceive themselves to be accepted by others in the educational environment, is also a key component.&nbsp;This can be supported by practices such as cooperative learning, participation in clubs and activities, utilizing a strengths based approach within the school and class, and providing a continuum of social-emotional and academic supports that ensure access to and success with curricular outcomes.&nbsp;Intentional actions that build relationships, such as the &ldquo;2 X 10&rdquo; strategy, which involves spending 2 minutes a day, 10 days in a row talking to a student about whatever they would like to talk about, also strengthens school connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community connectedness</strong>&nbsp;rounds out the circle of supports.&nbsp; Juvonen (2007) noted youth that can identify adults in the community that care about them experience a stronger sense of personal well-being.&nbsp;When youth feel safe, cared for and are provided opportunities to become connected to the community it broadens their sense of belonging.&nbsp;Furthermore, it provides the opportunity for further cultural connectedness, a strong predictor of emotional wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Get Loud image\" src=\"./images/content/Get-Loud-image-768x428.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GET LOUD</strong>.Finally, while making visible the protective factors of social-emotional competencies and the importance of a collective approach in ensuring connectedness, we also need to get loud about removing the stigma associated with mental illnesses.&nbsp;As one of the greatest barriers to treatment, recovery and societal acceptance, this stigma must be targeted and removed.&nbsp;To raise awareness, increase access to mental health resources and eliminate barriers to achieving full inclusion in society, GET LOUD during Mental Health Week (May 2 &ndash; 8):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Wear Green: Green ribbons were given in the 1800s to label people &ldquo;insane&rdquo;. Mental Health Awareness week is turning that on its head. Be proud and wear green!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud by Speaking Up: Don&rsquo;t suffer silently. Get loud about your own mental health and reach out to talk to someone you trust.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Be That Friend: Offer support, listen without judgement and take the time to ask how someone is doing. Reach out to that person you might not always reach out to.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Creative for Mental Health: Sing it, draw it, act it, or sculpt it. Make the importance of mental wellness visible!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud for Supports: Write letters, call, tweet your local elected representative to increase supports and access to mental health programs and services in your area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More ideas of how to Get Loud can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/</a>.&nbsp;Go there or tweet #GetLoud to share how you&rsquo;re getting loud during mental health week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Tips-for-Positive-Mental-Health.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n",

            "title": "Junior Kindergarten in FSD:  Alberta Early Learning Curriculum Framework Pilot",
            "article": "<p>By Cathy Bonnaventure,&nbsp;Director of Early Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our province has created an Alberta Early Learning and Child Care Curriculum Framework in response to the increasing recognition of the importance of early experiences to later development and the significance of the work that Early Childhood Educators do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Preschool kids\" src=\"./images/content/Preschool-kids-300x202.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The idea of a curriculum framework for young children might bring to mind a traditional curriculum &ndash; the kind you remember from grade school, where there&nbsp;were specific learning outcomes for subjects such as language arts and mathematics.&nbsp; In early learning, however, curriculum is focused on the uniqueness of childhood, considering learning with broad holistic goals for children&rsquo;s development and the importance of play, relationships and family diversity.&nbsp; The curriculum framework focuses on the process of the work Early&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height:1.6\">Childhood Educators do and the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height:1.6\">decisions that they make every day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Curriculum Framework is helping all Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) in our Junior Kindergarten classrooms build a common language, share and reflect.&nbsp; This current school year, two Junior Kindergarten programs in Foothills School Division have been participating in an Alberta Early Learning Curriculum Framework Pilot. &nbsp;The pilot sites in Foothills School Division are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Blackie School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Aileen Puurveen-Abmas, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>&Eacute;cole Percy Pegler School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Teresa Taylor, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>Foothills School Division ECS Administrator (me, Cathy Bonnaventure, Director of Early Learning)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot has consisted of three components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The first element of the process has been to connect with a professor from Mount Royal University who provides guidance about pedagogical leadership and ways to engage with Early Childhood Educators around the Curriculum Framework. I have been meeting on a monthly basis with the professor as well as attending learning community sessions with our own and other ECS administrators and Early Childhood Educators. The professor &mdash; also known as our pedagogical partners &mdash; and I have also been visiting the two pilot JK programs in FSD over the course of the pilot to engage with them in a variety of meaningful ways (e.g. spend time in the classroom, engage in planning time, provide opportunities for reflection and dialogue, etc.).</li>\r\n\t<li>The next component has involved bringing together eight (8) ECS educations/school division administrators from four school districts to build a learning community. As a learning community , we have been exploring the language, concepts and processes described in the curriculum documents. The learning community has been meeting once a month to examine our practice in light of questions such as: A) How do we document and make the learning of children visible to others? and B) What is our image of the child, how do we nurture their dispositions for learning, what is our role as the educator, and how do we best provide a learning environment that is responsive to the children&rsquo;s needs?</li>\r\n\t<li>The third component of this process is that the pilot classrooms and programs are visited monthly by a pedagogical partner (professor) from Mount Royal. They spend half a day per month with each ECE in their classroom. Having th epedagogical partner onside provides a means for guiding, support and reflecting on practice. It also provides the opportunity for coaching and mentoring to support the application of the curriculum framework concepts. The professor spends time in the classroom documenting and engaging the educators in dialogue about practice, discussing curriculum connects and curriculum reflections (e.g. planning). These coaching and mentoring opportunities are shared and integrated back into the learning community conversation sessions. This process serves to enhance the skills and practices of the teacher to enrich the experience with children while at the same time providing an experiential forum for discussion. I have also been joining the professor on visits with the JK programs whenever possible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECE&rsquo;s and Director are documenting their experiences throughout the pilot and plan to share what they are learning about the implementation of the Alberta Curriculum Framework in their classrooms at a Showcase at Mount Royal University on June 10, 2016.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the FSD webpage for more details about this exciting event!</p>\r\n",

            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;EVERY industry is desperate to hire computer programmers&rdquo; &ndash; Hadi Partovi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>10 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">PRINT</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(51, 153, 102)\">&ldquo;HELLO WORLD!&rdquo;</span> 20 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">GOTO</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 255)\">10</span></strong></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on when you went to school (for me the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s), you may or may not recognize the above chunk of BASIC code. For me it was an introduction to a whole new world. &nbsp;Not that this code did anything particularly useful &mdash; &nbsp;it filled the screen with a lot of text that scrolled so fast that you couldn&rsquo;t read it. Instead it was the engagement that occurred in realizing that &mdash; much like other forms of art &mdash; I could translate what I imagined into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I progressed into more advanced concepts and different programming languages I found myself exploring mathematical concepts such as variables, algebraic thinking, geometry, logic and patterning. &nbsp;I learned these concepts because I needed them order to make the computer do what I wanted it to. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even think of them as mathematical concepts until I was older and was exposed to them in math class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently I had the opportunity to attend a talk with Reshma Suanji, former Deputy Public Advocate for New York City, Candidate for the United States Congress and founder of the advocacy group &ldquo;Girls who Code&rdquo;. (<a href=\"http://girlswhocode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://girlswhocode.com</a>) During this powerful presentation, Reshma shared some startling statistics regarding economic shifts that could have an&nbsp;immediate impact on our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In 2008 there were 8 million manufacturing jobs lost in the USA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Higher wage technical work grew in that same span of time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Today, computer software engineers are the fastest growing industry for employment with Computer Science close behind.</li>\r\n\t<li>The gender gap in computer sciences is growing.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 1984, 37% of students graduating computer science programs were women; today that ratio is closer to 18%.</li>\r\n\t<li>Although women make up almost half of the US workforce, only 25% of the jobs in technical or computing fields are held by females.</li>\r\n\t<li>It has been predicted that by 2020, 1.4 million computer specialists will be needed in the USA with only enough graduates to fill 29% of them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technical jobs are no longer specific to technical industries. Most industries need staff skilled in computer sciences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The question then is how do we expose our students to these important foundational&nbsp;skills? How can our students benefit from engaging lessons in creativity, problem solving, logic and numeracy? How do we prepare students for &ldquo;their future, not our past&rdquo;(Pink, 2011)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a student, coding or programming meant that I needed to learn a complex text based language. Today, modern tools have made these skills more accessible to all. &nbsp;Although these tools still enable students to creatively explore computer processes, logic, patterns, numeracy and other concepts, students can explore these ideas without having to learn formal text based programming languages. &nbsp;For example &ldquo;Scratch&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://scratch.mit.edu&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948071000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ6iCmadyEieIaGRiuSWYI1Byw0A\">http://scratch.mit.edu</a>&nbsp;and its more complex cousin &ldquo;Stencyl&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stencyl.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDi2QtYDpQ-GMc4bx7kU-wmKaqBA\">http://www.stencyl.com</a>&nbsp;provide environments where students can drag and drop code chunks to create engaging games without needing to learn a formal programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:246px\" title=\"\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture2.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:259px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great way that kids of multiple ages can explore these skills and concepts is by participating in Code.Org&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hour of Code&rdquo; project:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://code.org/learn&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948073000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQPnzjFqLiRNVnvf9_Ue4JmLV0mA\">http://code.org/learn</a>.

In a recent TED Talk, Hadi Partovi talked about the importance of projects like this to preparing students for the future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m-U9wzC9xLk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.208px; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background: transparent;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these tools, many of our students explore these concepts through &ldquo;makerspaces&rdquo;. These are classroom and other school based opportunities for students to work with robotics and electronics and, for older students, computer modules such as the Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;Younger students can even work with paper versions of common code blocks&nbsp;by practicing&nbsp;placing them in a logical sequence. These tools are available for all Foothills classrooms through our Instructional Media Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opportunities for students to explore coding have never been better and the need has never been greater. We need to give our children the opportunity to express themselves and create using these technologies as this will be the language of their&nbsp;world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are always welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n",

            "article": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 252, 252); color:rgb(68, 68, 68)\">By Allen Davidson,&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Employee Services</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Wednesday October 5, 2016 marks World Teachers&rsquo; Day, which is recognized in over 100 countries, to acknowledge the vital contributions that teachers make to students and society. In a world where every individual interest, issue or item can garner recognition on some calendar or another it becomes difficult to attribute any significance to such a recognition. Depending on the source you look at last few weeks included the following list of world recognition days on the calendar:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Talk Like a Pirate Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Care Free Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Tourism Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Rabies Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Maritime Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Sight Day, and</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Coffee Day.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let&rsquo;s face it, it can be difficult as a citizen to set aside time in your day to mindfully reflect and give a true appreciation to all of these important (or less important) recognitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Still, I urge everyone to do just that here in Foothills School Division as we consider the over 500 Teachers and 110 Guest Teachers supporting our nearly 8000 students. When we contemplate the impact each individual teacher can make on the lives of their students over the course of a year and a career we should all be deeply invested in not only recognizing and appreciating teachers but in collectively ensuring our Teachers are supported to be among the best in the world at their profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In FSD 38 our professional teaching staff is grateful to have a school community lead by our Trustees who recognize this in many ways. This Friday Foothills School Division teachers will be engaged in collaborative professional learning with their colleagues across the Division on one of our 13 Professional Learning Days that are built into the school calendar. These days are essential for teachers to have consistent and regular opportunities to learn from each other, collectively review their instructional practice in light of student assessment, and maintain their understanding of how all students learn. Such an investment indeed allows our staff the opportunity to continuously improve and be among the best at their profession. This learning is vital when educational research reliably demonstrates that having a quality teacher is the most important factor in student achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So, as we mark World Teachers&rsquo; Day this Wednesday and teachers engage in ongoing professional learning this Friday I urge you join me in showing our collective appreciation for Teachers!</p>\r\n",

            "title": "Should the Government of Alberta be funding private schools?",
            "article": "<p>By Drew Chipman,&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Corporate Services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been quite a bit of back and forth in the news lately regarding public funding of private schools and whether or not the Government of Alberta should continue to provide them with funding. There are arguments on both sides of the issue: those arguing that it takes dollars away from public education and those stating that it saves money because if those students were in the public system they would be 100% funded vs. the 60 or 70% private schools receive.&nbsp; Another pro-private school funding argument is that private schools provide more &ldquo;choice&rdquo; and that taking away funding diminishes that option for families interested in a private school education for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private schools wishing to access provincial funding must fit within two different classes to qualify for provincial support: Level 1 funded private schools have to follow basic reporting requirements and government oversight to obtain 60% funding.&nbsp; Level 2 funded private schools agree to additional scrutiny by fully participating in the provincial accountability program and, once accepted as a Level 2 school must stay at that level in order to receive 70% funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how many students are attending private schools in Alberta?&nbsp; One report written in 2015 by&nbsp;Van Pelt, Nevins, Brown and&nbsp;Palacios1&nbsp;revealed that in 2013 there were slightly less than 25,000 private school students out of more than 619,000 students, or 3.9% of the student population. This number, while not insignificant, is the second lowest of all but the Maritime provinces according to the same report. Between 2001-2013, private school attendance increased as a percentage of total student population in every province except Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; this despite the fact that many of these provinces have not increased contributions to private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Alberta, private schools were funded at 50% of public school funding until 1998 when it was increased to 60%. In 2008, private schools received another increase to 70% for those schools agreeing to the Level 2 certification. In both instances, public schools and their boards had little input into the changes. Currently, the Alberta School Boards Association is asking the provincial government to redirect the approximately $248 million dollars paid to private schools into public education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ourkids.net/\">www.ourkids.net</a>, states that private schools in Alberta charge between $5,000 and $50,000 a year for tuition. If you look at what Foothills School Division receives from the province each year per student, approximately $10,900 through a variety of grants (based on our 2014/15 Audited Financial Statement), you can see that the addition of provincial funding (up to 70% of public school funding) can&nbsp;give private schools a significant leg up on what they have to spend per student compared to&nbsp;public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the fact that private schools receive provincial funding over and above tuition charged,&nbsp;it is important to note that private schools&nbsp;set the criteria for enrolment. For example, they can accept or turn away students with physical or learning disabilities. While public education in the province celebrates its diversity and the fact that we are inclusive&nbsp;of all students, the public, government and private sectors often compare our student results to those of our private school counterparts. It is not an &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The argument that if the government doesn&rsquo;t provide funding to private schools those students will come back to the public systems and then the province will have to provide full funding for all 25,000 private schools students may seem to make sense on the surface. The &nbsp;reasoning goes on to say that if private students are added back into the system it will then reduce the amount of funding available per student across the province. &nbsp;However, if Ontario is any indication, this is certainly not the case. They have a significantly higher number of private schools and students (both in raw numbers and as a percentage of total student population) and yet they provide no provincial funding for private schools. One can surmise that those desiring a private school education for their children are not motivated by the amount of provincial funding private schools receive, or lack thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foothills School Division is certainly in favour of educational choice for students and families. However, we are not sure that choice means provincial funding for private schools&nbsp;should have to accompany that determination. &nbsp;In fact, FSD trustees recently passed a motion &ldquo;in favour of a funding model that fully supports our public education system and does not diminish or erode funding from public education in Alberta.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this information in hand, perhaps it&rsquo;s time that the Province reviewed its stance on the continued funding of private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/where-our-students-are-educated-measuring-student-enrolment-in-canada.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Where Our Students Are Educated: Measuring Student Enrolment in Canada</a></p>\r\n",

            "article": "<h2>By Darlene Cox, FNMI Success Connector, Oilfields School/Longview School</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuesday, June 21 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100013718/1100100013719\" target=\"_blank\">National Aboriginal Day</a>&nbsp;in Canada.&nbsp;This is the day then Governor General of Canada, Rom&eacute;o Leblanc designated 20 years ago&nbsp;to recognize and celebrate Canada&rsquo;s First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit culture and their outstanding contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I would like to share some information on my background and my work in FSD. I am M&eacute;tis/Swampy Cree, and I am the&nbsp;division&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit Success Connector. I am based primarily out of the Oilfields and Longview schools. Between the&nbsp;two, there&nbsp;are approximately 65 self-identified First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit students. Through FSD&rsquo;s&nbsp;First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit (FNMI) program, we celebrate and share the diverse indigenous culture of our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be familiar with&nbsp;the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action</a>, developed by Canada&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=905\" target=\"_blank\">Truth and Reconciliation Commission&nbsp;</a>to &ldquo;redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oilfields&rsquo; FNMI program is leading the way by acting on actions 63.ii and 63.iii:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>63.&nbsp; We call upon the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada to maintain an annual commitment to Aboriginal education issues, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii.&nbsp; Sharing information and best practices on teaching curriculum related to residential schools and Aboriginal history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Building student capacity for intercultural understanding, empathy, and mutual respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we have created an area for our FNMI students to share space and culture with other students. &ldquo;Turtle Lodge&rdquo; in the Learning Commons showcases the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ojibweresources.weebly.com/ojibwe-teachings--the-7-grandfathers.html\" target=\"_blank\">7 Grandfather Teachings</a>, indigenous medicines, reading materials, indigenous events, and education opportunities, and has become a very popular place for all students.&nbsp;Turtle Lodge was named by 2015 Oilfields graduate Tashena Daniels of the Stoney Nakoda Nation, Eden Valley Band, for Turtle Island, which is what our First Nations people called North America pre-European contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Oilfields we believe it is important to bridge the gap between FNMI students, including their culture and history, with other students. For most FNMI activities we invite all students of Oilfields and Longview to participate,&nbsp;giving students the space and time&nbsp;to build relationships, and&nbsp;gain a better understanding of all cultures and backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Students participating in a Blanket Exercise, a tool to share the historic &amp; contemporary relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada. Blankets arranged on the floor represent land and participants are invited to step into the roles of FNMI peoples</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This spring, over 50&nbsp;Oilfields students &mdash; both indigenous and non-indigenous &mdash;&nbsp;participated in an experiential learning project.&nbsp;They wrote, directed, acted and filmed&nbsp;four short films,&nbsp;#TRC4Reelz, based on the theme &ldquo;Reconciliation&nbsp;Through the Eyes of our Youth&rdquo;. The purpose of the project was to explore the true story of reconciliation; the films were the bonus. Barriers were worked through; understanding, empathy and mutual respect&nbsp;were created; and the landscape of&nbsp;Oilfields&nbsp;has positively&nbsp;changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 2nd,&nbsp;22 Oilfields film students were invited to attend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/redx-talks-to-lead-debate-on-truth-reconciliation-and-future\" target=\"_blank\">REDx Talks: Truth, Reconciliation and the Future&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(indigenous version of Ted Talks*) at the University of Calgary.&nbsp; Mentorship and creating youth mentors is key to the success of all our youth. They are the future to breaking the cycles of colonization and the tragic legacy left behind from residential schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOXcFZgzhI\" target=\"_blank\">Circle of Courage</a>&nbsp; (see the Solution Tree video for an explanation) is the basis of&nbsp;our work in FSD:&nbsp;the spirit of generosity, the spirit of belonging, the spirit of mastery, the spirit of independence. We invite all to join us in embracing these teachings and partaking in the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiy Hiy (Thank You)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darlene Cox</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:coxd@fsd38.ab.ca\">coxd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less).

            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about failure &ndash; I think about iterating!&rdquo;(Wagner, 2012, p. 44).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image00.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />In previous posts, I&rsquo;ve spoken at length about the potential risks our children must navigate in an increasingly technology driven and connected world. Since technology is however a key component of both their lives and ours, the question needs to be bigger than, &ldquo;how do we keep our kids safe from technology?&rdquo; We must also ask, &ldquo;To what extent can technology help our children become critical thinkers, innovative problem solvers and resilient, ethical citizens?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enter the &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; movement.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image03.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Student jaws drop when I tell them that I am older than the internet (just barely &ndash; to be fair). For&nbsp;many of us that grew up in that era, we had TVs with a mechanical knob (and the semi-reliable fine tune), computers existed (however, very few people had them in their homes), music was delivered via spinning vinyl, and robots were personable thinking trashcans on movie screens. Yet, because things were simpler, we understood how to fix them. Seeing a car hood open or a washing machine taken apart was not uncommon. &nbsp;Science kits like the classic Radio Shack electronics project kits, were popular toys that let kids make sense of how things worked. When things didn&rsquo;t work we fixed them or &ldquo;jerry rigged&rdquo; a replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image01.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />Today, technology is commonplace and often takes the form of warranty sealed, tamper proof devices. &nbsp;Everything you buy has a computer in it and most devices take the form of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;. &nbsp;For example, do you know what the inside of your cellular phone looks like or how it works?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why in education we look to &ldquo;maker spaces&rdquo;. &nbsp;Places where students can inquire into how things work and invent solutions to authentic problems. These maker spaces take multiple forms. For example, a design lab where students use software like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sketchup.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGv7CsupNGxy31b6_-M37WXU1pNQ\">Google Sketchup</a>&nbsp;to design a solution to a problem and then use a fabrication device known as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283417000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq8l8B8l9eDa9jS35ZPllhixACtg\">3D printer</a>&nbsp;to instantly render and test a prototype. In a Science or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://albertactf.ca/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464821283418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdoqIwYbbr0MA8x6ZvsiykwuVEnw\">Career and Technology Foundations</a>&nbsp;classroom students may design and build circuits or modular robots to solve a problem or perform a task. &nbsp;Schools are even including makerspaces to give students a place to explore ideas from their personal interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/image02.png\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px; width:300px\" title=\"\" />The common element in all of this is that the students are inventing and problem solving. They are seeking to understand how things work and using that understanding to create and design new solutions to complex and authentic problems. &nbsp;They learn to &ldquo;troubleshoot&rdquo; their designs when they don&rsquo;t work as expected. They learn to think critically and&nbsp;repeatedly about design elements and might go through multiple revisions until finally settling on a solution. Most importantly, they learn to be persistent problem solvers who expect problems to be both challenging and based in the real world &mdash;&nbsp;a skill that helps them not only with school based curriculum, but also prepares them to be resilient lifelong learners in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca\">+stevensd@gm.fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagner, T.

            "title": "A Downside of Mobile Technology",
            "article": "<p>By Lyle Roberts,&nbsp;Director of Learning Technologies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of mobile devices is becoming&nbsp;increasingly prevalent as time goes on. The reasons behind this are varied, however, having a portable device that can be used anywhere, anytime is proving to be a valuable tool for most people. No longer are you required to have a fixed location to do whatever you want. In fact, being able to do your work or have fun at your fingertips makes things more convenient. However,&nbsp;there is a down side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It used to be that there were certain brands of computing devices that people gravitated to for all of their computing needs. There is still an element of a particular brand of computing device that works better or has a better interface for a certain task. However,&nbsp;in general, this preference&nbsp;for branding is going away and now it has more to do with functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from desktop computing to tablets to mobile computing using cell phones and specialized devices. We&rsquo;re now looking at wearable devices that are designed to track how far you walk, how many stairs you climb, and what your sleep activity levels are like. Many also track your food intake and are able to calculate the calories that you use in a day or for a particular activity. Most of these are used to improve health and, as long as they are used correctly, will do a fairly good job of informing the user of trends and nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a&nbsp;negative use of these types of wearable technologies that track food intake and activity. One such app that is available is used by people suffering with anorexia to limit their caloric intake. In speaking with a dietician recently they called it the, &ldquo;Anorexic&rsquo;s Friend&rdquo;, meaning that people with this condition are using the information that they get from the app to negatively affect their overall health by helping them restrict food intake and&nbsp;the types of&nbsp;foods that they eat in order to lose even more weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the majority of the population&nbsp;reducing their&nbsp;food intake is not a negative thing; instead, it can be a positive way to encourage good health, better nutrition&nbsp;and increased activity. However, when someone suffering with anorexia is&nbsp; trying to lose even more weight, this obviously will have a detrimental effect on the health of the human body. Essentially the lack of calories and nutrients eventually puts the lives of these people at risk unless the cycle of starvation can be reversed. This is not easily done as there are many underlying factors to this condition. Health professionals continue to struggle with how best to treat individuals with this condition. One suggestion would be to use the app to help the individual&nbsp;gain&nbsp;weight rather than lose&nbsp;it, but this requires a huge mind shift in their thinking. A second suggestion would be to make sure that they don&rsquo;t use these types of apps at all so they are unable to&nbsp;track their caloric intake as readily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In either case, anorexia is a complex condition. If technology&nbsp;can help them on the road to recovery,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all for it. However,&nbsp;if the technology is&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;destructive behavior and harming their health, we need to&nbsp;be wary of&nbsp;the use of these types of apps. If you&rsquo;re a parent, be as vigilant as possible about the apps and activities that your children have on their smart phones and other devices.</p>\r\n",

            "title": "It's Time to GET LOUD",
            "article": "<p>By Loriann Salmon,&nbsp;Director of Inclusive Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interplay between success at school and emotional health cannot be ignored and speaks loudly to the need for educators, parents and the community to be active partners in supporting the mental wellness of our children and youth. &nbsp;May 2 &ndash; 8 is Mental Health Week and it&rsquo;s time for all of us to&nbsp;<strong>GET LOUD</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Mental health stat\" src=\"./images/content/Mental-health-stat-293x300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The emergence of recommended universal proactive practices has shifted the focus from one of diagnosing and repairing weakness to a whole school and community approach&nbsp;of supporting the social-emotional development of all students. Collectively, we can all make a difference for our kids.&nbsp;We can support the emotional health of our children and youth through intentional evidence based practices.&nbsp;Two such practices that are found to support the emotional wellness of our youth include a focus on social-emotional learning and connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies results in enhanced positive attitudes about self and others, strengthens connections to school, increases academic performance and reduces both externalizing and internalizing behaviours (Payton et al, 2008; Ashdown &amp; Bernard, 2012).&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence based curriculums such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zonesofregulation.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zones of Regulation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/\" target=\"_blank\">MindUP&trade;</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youthrelationships.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fourth R</a>&nbsp;ensure that these competencies are explicitly taught and then opportunities provided to be practiced throughout the day.&nbsp;Connecting parents to these programs through effective two-way communication ensures that a common language and skills can be reinforced and practiced in all areas of life, both at school and home. These core competencies are not only identified as protective factors contributing to emotional health and resiliency but also enhances connection to others, also considered to be an essential factor in supporting mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connectedness, closely related to the basic need of belonging, takes the intentional work of all stakeholders. Teaming of all stakeholders to develop connectedness is an essential structure in supporting the emotional well-being of our youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family-school connections</strong>&nbsp;where parents are positively and meaningfully involved in their child&rsquo;s learning and connected with the school themselves influences students&rsquo; perception of the importance of school and engagement with school and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peer connectedness</strong>&nbsp;is also essential, particularly as students get older and their peer group becomes more important.&nbsp;Friendship is a strong predictor of life outcomes and focusing on the development of pro-social attitudes through positive interactions with others is essential.&nbsp;In supporting quality of interactions, intentional practices such as classroom circles ensures every student&rsquo;s voice is heard, empathy is developed, and quality relationships and interactions are fostered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School connectedness</strong>, or how students perceive themselves to be accepted by others in the educational environment, is also a key component.&nbsp;This can be supported by practices such as cooperative learning, participation in clubs and activities, utilizing a strengths based approach within the school and class, and providing a continuum of social-emotional and academic supports that ensure access to and success with curricular outcomes.&nbsp;Intentional actions that build relationships, such as the &ldquo;2 X 10&rdquo; strategy, which involves spending 2 minutes a day, 10 days in a row talking to a student about whatever they would like to talk about, also strengthens school connectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community connectedness</strong>&nbsp;rounds out the circle of supports.&nbsp; Juvonen (2007) noted youth that can identify adults in the community that care about them experience a stronger sense of personal well-being.&nbsp;When youth feel safe, cared for and are provided opportunities to become connected to the community it broadens their sense of belonging.&nbsp;Furthermore, it provides the opportunity for further cultural connectedness, a strong predictor of emotional wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Get Loud image\" src=\"./images/content/Get-Loud-image-768x428.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GET LOUD</strong>.Finally, while making visible the protective factors of social-emotional competencies and the importance of a collective approach in ensuring connectedness, we also need to get loud about removing the stigma associated with mental illnesses.&nbsp;As one of the greatest barriers to treatment, recovery and societal acceptance, this stigma must be targeted and removed.&nbsp;To raise awareness, increase access to mental health resources and eliminate barriers to achieving full inclusion in society, GET LOUD during Mental Health Week (May 2 &ndash; 8):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Wear Green: Green ribbons were given in the 1800s to label people &ldquo;insane&rdquo;. Mental Health Awareness week is turning that on its head. Be proud and wear green!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud by Speaking Up: Don&rsquo;t suffer silently. Get loud about your own mental health and reach out to talk to someone you trust.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Be That Friend: Offer support, listen without judgement and take the time to ask how someone is doing. Reach out to that person you might not always reach out to.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud and Creative for Mental Health: Sing it, draw it, act it, or sculpt it. Make the importance of mental wellness visible!</li>\r\n\t<li>Get Loud for Supports: Write letters, call, tweet your local elected representative to increase supports and access to mental health programs and services in your area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More ideas of how to Get Loud can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mentalhealthweek.ca/</a>.&nbsp;Go there or tweet #GetLoud to share how you&rsquo;re getting loud during mental health week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Tips-for-Positive-Mental-Health.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n",

            "title": "Junior Kindergarten in FSD:  Alberta Early Learning Curriculum Framework Pilot",
            "article": "<p>By Cathy Bonnaventure,&nbsp;Director of Early Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our province has created an Alberta Early Learning and Child Care Curriculum Framework in response to the increasing recognition of the importance of early experiences to later development and the significance of the work that Early Childhood Educators do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Preschool kids\" src=\"./images/content/Preschool-kids-300x202.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 25px 25px\" />The idea of a curriculum framework for young children might bring to mind a traditional curriculum &ndash; the kind you remember from grade school, where there&nbsp;were specific learning outcomes for subjects such as language arts and mathematics.&nbsp; In early learning, however, curriculum is focused on the uniqueness of childhood, considering learning with broad holistic goals for children&rsquo;s development and the importance of play, relationships and family diversity.&nbsp; The curriculum framework focuses on the process of the work Early&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height:1.6\">Childhood Educators do and the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height:1.6\">decisions that they make every day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Curriculum Framework is helping all Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) in our Junior Kindergarten classrooms build a common language, share and reflect.&nbsp; This current school year, two Junior Kindergarten programs in Foothills School Division have been participating in an Alberta Early Learning Curriculum Framework Pilot. &nbsp;The pilot sites in Foothills School Division are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Blackie School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Aileen Puurveen-Abmas, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>&Eacute;cole Percy Pegler School &ndash; Junior Kindergarten (Teresa Taylor, Early Childhood Educator)</li>\r\n\t<li>Foothills School Division ECS Administrator (me, Cathy Bonnaventure, Director of Early Learning)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot has consisted of three components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The first element of the process has been to connect with a professor from Mount Royal University who provides guidance about pedagogical leadership and ways to engage with Early Childhood Educators around the Curriculum Framework. I have been meeting on a monthly basis with the professor as well as attending learning community sessions with our own and other ECS administrators and Early Childhood Educators. The professor &mdash; also known as our pedagogical partners &mdash; and I have also been visiting the two pilot JK programs in FSD over the course of the pilot to engage with them in a variety of meaningful ways (e.g. spend time in the classroom, engage in planning time, provide opportunities for reflection and dialogue, etc.).</li>\r\n\t<li>The next component has involved bringing together eight (8) ECS educations/school division administrators from four school districts to build a learning community. As a learning community , we have been exploring the language, concepts and processes described in the curriculum documents. The learning community has been meeting once a month to examine our practice in light of questions such as: A) How do we document and make the learning of children visible to others? and B) What is our image of the child, how do we nurture their dispositions for learning, what is our role as the educator, and how do we best provide a learning environment that is responsive to the children&rsquo;s needs?</li>\r\n\t<li>The third component of this process is that the pilot classrooms and programs are visited monthly by a pedagogical partner (professor) from Mount Royal. They spend half a day per month with each ECE in their classroom. Having th epedagogical partner onside provides a means for guiding, support and reflecting on practice. It also provides the opportunity for coaching and mentoring to support the application of the curriculum framework concepts. The professor spends time in the classroom documenting and engaging the educators in dialogue about practice, discussing curriculum connects and curriculum reflections (e.g. planning). These coaching and mentoring opportunities are shared and integrated back into the learning community conversation sessions. This process serves to enhance the skills and practices of the teacher to enrich the experience with children while at the same time providing an experiential forum for discussion. I have also been joining the professor on visits with the JK programs whenever possible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECE&rsquo;s and Director are documenting their experiences throughout the pilot and plan to share what they are learning about the implementation of the Alberta Curriculum Framework in their classrooms at a Showcase at Mount Royal University on June 10, 2016.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the FSD webpage for more details about this exciting event!</p>\r\n",

            "article": "<p>By Doug Stevens,&nbsp;Director of Distributed Learning</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;EVERY industry is desperate to hire computer programmers&rdquo; &ndash; Hadi Partovi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>10 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">PRINT</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(51, 153, 102)\">&ldquo;HELLO WORLD!&rdquo;</span> 20 <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\">GOTO</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 255)\">10</span></strong></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on when you went to school (for me the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s), you may or may not recognize the above chunk of BASIC code. For me it was an introduction to a whole new world. &nbsp;Not that this code did anything particularly useful &mdash; &nbsp;it filled the screen with a lot of text that scrolled so fast that you couldn&rsquo;t read it. Instead it was the engagement that occurred in realizing that &mdash; much like other forms of art &mdash; I could translate what I imagined into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I progressed into more advanced concepts and different programming languages I found myself exploring mathematical concepts such as variables, algebraic thinking, geometry, logic and patterning. &nbsp;I learned these concepts because I needed them order to make the computer do what I wanted it to. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even think of them as mathematical concepts until I was older and was exposed to them in math class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently I had the opportunity to attend a talk with Reshma Suanji, former Deputy Public Advocate for New York City, Candidate for the United States Congress and founder of the advocacy group &ldquo;Girls who Code&rdquo;. (<a href=\"http://girlswhocode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://girlswhocode.com</a>) During this powerful presentation, Reshma shared some startling statistics regarding economic shifts that could have an&nbsp;immediate impact on our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In 2008 there were 8 million manufacturing jobs lost in the USA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Higher wage technical work grew in that same span of time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Today, computer software engineers are the fastest growing industry for employment with Computer Science close behind.</li>\r\n\t<li>The gender gap in computer sciences is growing.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 1984, 37% of students graduating computer science programs were women; today that ratio is closer to 18%.</li>\r\n\t<li>Although women make up almost half of the US workforce, only 25% of the jobs in technical or computing fields are held by females.</li>\r\n\t<li>It has been predicted that by 2020, 1.4 million computer specialists will be needed in the USA with only enough graduates to fill 29% of them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technical jobs are no longer specific to technical industries. Most industries need staff skilled in computer sciences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The question then is how do we expose our students to these important foundational&nbsp;skills? How can our students benefit from engaging lessons in creativity, problem solving, logic and numeracy? How do we prepare students for &ldquo;their future, not our past&rdquo;(Pink, 2011)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a student, coding or programming meant that I needed to learn a complex text based language. Today, modern tools have made these skills more accessible to all. &nbsp;Although these tools still enable students to creatively explore computer processes, logic, patterns, numeracy and other concepts, students can explore these ideas without having to learn formal text based programming languages. &nbsp;For example &ldquo;Scratch&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://scratch.mit.edu&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948071000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ6iCmadyEieIaGRiuSWYI1Byw0A\">http://scratch.mit.edu</a>&nbsp;and its more complex cousin &ldquo;Stencyl&rdquo;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stencyl.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDi2QtYDpQ-GMc4bx7kU-wmKaqBA\">http://www.stencyl.com</a>&nbsp;provide environments where students can drag and drop code chunks to create engaging games without needing to learn a formal programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:246px\" title=\"\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"./images/content/Capture2.JPG\" style=\"background:transparent; border:0px; font-size:14.208px; height:303px; margin:0px 0px 0.5em; outline:0px; padding:0px; transform:rotate(0rad) translateZ(0px); vertical-align:baseline; width:259px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great way that kids of multiple ages can explore these skills and concepts is by participating in Code.Org&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hour of Code&rdquo; project:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://code.org/learn&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459444948073000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQPnzjFqLiRNVnvf9_Ue4JmLV0mA\">http://code.org/learn</a>. This project provides all the tools and instruction needed to create interactive games using Minecraft characters, Angry Birds, Disney Infinity characters and more! In a recent TED Talk, Hadi Partovi talked about the importance of projects like this to preparing students for the future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m-U9wzC9xLk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.208px; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background: transparent;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these tools, many of our students explore these concepts through &ldquo;makerspaces&rdquo;. These are classroom and other school based opportunities for students to work with robotics and electronics and, for older students, computer modules such as the Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;Younger students can even work with paper versions of common code blocks&nbsp;by practicing&nbsp;placing them in a logical sequence. These tools are available for all Foothills classrooms through our Instructional Media Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opportunities for students to explore coding have never been better and the need has never been greater. We need to give our children the opportunity to express themselves and create using these technologies as this will be the language of their&nbsp;world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are always welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in learning,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Stevens</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca\">stevensd@fsd38.ab.ca</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>@dstlearn</p>\r\n",

            "title": "Celebrating World Teachers' Day",
            "article": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 252, 252); color:rgb(68, 68, 68)\">By Allen Davidson,&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Employee Services</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Wednesday October 5, 2016 marks World Teachers&rsquo; Day, which is recognized in over 100 countries, to acknowledge the vital contributions that teachers make to students and society. In a world where every individual interest, issue or item can garner recognition on some calendar or another it becomes difficult to attribute any significance to such a recognition. Depending on the source you look at last few weeks included the following list of world recognition days on the calendar:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Talk Like a Pirate Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Care Free Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Tourism Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Rabies Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Maritime Day,</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>World Sight Day, and</em></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>International Coffee Day.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let&rsquo;s face it, it can be difficult as a citizen to set aside time in your day to mindfully reflect and give a true appreciation to all of these important (or less important) recognitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Still, I urge everyone to do just that here in Foothills School Division as we consider the over 500 Teachers and 110 Guest Teachers supporting our nearly 8000 students. When we contemplate the impact each individual teacher can make on the lives of their students over the course of a year and a career we should all be deeply invested in not only recognizing and appreciating teachers but in collectively ensuring our Teachers are supported to be among the best in the world at their profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In FSD 38 our professional teaching staff is grateful to have a school community lead by our Trustees who recognize this in many ways. This Friday Foothills School Division teachers will be engaged in collaborative professional learning with their colleagues across the Division on one of our 13 Professional Learning Days that are built into the school calendar. These days are essential for teachers to have consistent and regular opportunities to learn from each other, collectively review their instructional practice in light of student assessment, and maintain their understanding of how all students learn. Such an investment indeed allows our staff the opportunity to continuously improve and be among the best at their profession. This learning is vital when educational research reliably demonstrates that having a quality teacher is the most important factor in student achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So, as we mark World Teachers&rsquo; Day this Wednesday and teachers engage in ongoing professional learning this Friday I urge you join me in showing our collective appreciation for Teachers!</p>\r\n",
